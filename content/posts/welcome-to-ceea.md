# Welcome to CEEA Bocconi

We're thrilled to launch **CEEA Bocconi** — a student-led association dedicated to building bridges across Central & Eastern Europe right here at Bocconi University.

## Our Mission

CEEA exists to connect students from — and interested in — the CEE region through:

- **Career events** with top employers active in the region
- **Cultural programming** that celebrates our shared heritage
- **Community building** across nationalities and disciplines

## What's Next

Stay tuned for our upcoming flagship events, speaker panels, and networking nights. We'll share updates right here in the newsletter.
