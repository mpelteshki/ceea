# CEEA Bocconi: Concept + Content Ideas

## What a Bocconi Association Is (Practical View)

A Bocconi student association is a student-run organization that:

- Builds a recognizable community on campus (membership + committee roles).
- Runs repeatable programming (events and collaborations) through the academic year.
- Operates with a real execution stack: logistics, partnerships, marketing, finance, and governance.
- Is visible and legible to the campus: people know what you do, when you recruit, and what your “signature” is.

At its best, it behaves like a small institution: clear ownership, consistent cadence, and a reliable partner experience.

## Observed Patterns From Current Bocconi Associations

Across strong Bocconi associations, the recurring “moves” are:

- Clear pillars (e.g. career / community / culture) and a seasonal cadence (flagship + smaller formats).
- A very simple public website: mission, events, partners, team, contact, recruitment.
- Heavy collaboration: co-hosted panels/workshops with other associations.
- “Partner-ready” execution: sponsor tiers, predictable deliverables, clean comms, post-event recap.

## What CEEA Can Own

CEEA’s edge is narrative and context. The region is diverse, but the shared themes are recognizable:

- Cross-border identity (language, diaspora, dual perspectives).
- Markets in motion (EU integration, rapid modernization, rebuilding, demographic shifts).
- Talent mobility (Milan as a node in a wider network).

## Programming Ideas (High Signal, Low Fluff)

Flagship (1 per semester):

- “Danube Dialogues”: speakers + curated cultural moment (music, visuals, food) with a clean sponsor story.

Career bridge (monthly):

- CEE hiring workshop with a partner firm (CV + case + office-hours).
- Alumni “routes”: 6 alumni, 6 micro-stories, 60 minutes.

Culture/community (bi-weekly):

- Language tandems (rotating pairs, structured prompts).
- “Kitchen table” dinner series (10-14 people, one topic, one host).
- City walk: Milan through CEE lenses (design, architecture, migration stories).

Collabs:

- Joint panels with finance/consulting/tech associations to avoid siloing.

## Website IA (What We Built)

- Home: mission + upcoming events + formats
- Events: filters and RSVP links (Convex-powered)
- About: pillars and “how association life works”
- Partners: packaging + formats
- Contact: clear asks
- Admin: create/delete events (Clerk + Convex auth)

## Visual Direction

“Editorial atlas”:

- High-contrast serif display type (Bodoni) for identity and Milan context.
- Technical sans + mono (IBM Plex) for credibility and “institution” feel.
- Paper/ink palette with Danube blue + carmine accents.
- A subtle grid and contour-like texture to evoke mapping without clichés.
